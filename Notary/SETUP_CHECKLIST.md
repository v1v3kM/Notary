# 🎯 Supabase Database Setup Checklist

Your AppointmentScheduler is **ready to use real Supabase backend**! Follow this checklist to complete the setup.

## ✅ **Current Status**
- ✅ Supabase URL configured: `https://uqrxpioddehgqwtbhjsx.supabase.co`
- ✅ API Key configured and valid
- ✅ Demo mode disabled (will use real backend)
- ✅ Development server running on http://localhost:3000
- ✅ AppointmentScheduler component ready for real data

## 📋 **Setup Checklist**

### Step 1: Create Database Tables (Required)
1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/uqrxpioddehgqwtbhjsx
2. **Go to SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
3. **Run Setup Script**:
   - Copy the entire content from: `src/scripts/setup-supabase-tables.sql`
   - Paste and execute in SQL Editor
   - Should see: "Appointment system tables created successfully!"

### Step 2: Add Sample Data (Recommended)
1. **Run Sample Data Script**:
   - Copy the entire content from: `src/scripts/insert-sample-data.sql`
   - Paste and execute in SQL Editor
   - Should see: "Sample data inserted successfully!"

### Step 3: Test the Integration
1. **Visit Your App**: http://localhost:3000/book (or wherever AppointmentScheduler is mounted)
2. **Expected Behavior**:
   - Shows "Loading lawyers..." initially
   - Displays real lawyers from Supabase database
   - Allows booking appointments that persist to database

## 🔍 **How to Verify It's Working**

### Frontend Indicators
- ✅ Loading states appear when fetching data
- ✅ Real lawyer profiles display (not demo data)
- ✅ Date selection loads actual availability slots
- ✅ Booking creates persistent records

### Supabase Dashboard Verification
1. **Check Tables**: Go to Table Editor > lawyer_profiles
   - Should see 3 sample lawyers if you ran the sample data script
2. **Check Availability**: Table Editor > availability_slots
   - Should see slots for next 14 days
3. **Test Booking**: Make a test appointment
   - Check Table Editor > appointments for new records

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### ❌ "No lawyers found matching your criteria"
**Solution**: Database tables not set up
```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
-- Copy entire content from src/scripts/setup-supabase-tables.sql
```

### ❌ "Loading lawyers..." never finishes
**Causes**:
1. Internet connection issues
2. Supabase project not accessible
3. API key expired or incorrect

**Debug**:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Supabase dashboard is accessible
3. Check .env.local has correct URL and key

### ❌ "Permission denied" errors
**Solution**: RLS policies not configured properly
```sql
-- RLS policies are included in setup-supabase-tables.sql
-- Make sure you ran the complete script
```

### ❌ Booking fails with authentication error
**Current Setup**: Demo authentication is enabled
**Future**: Implement real Supabase auth in AuthContext
